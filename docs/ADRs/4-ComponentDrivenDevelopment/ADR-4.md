# ADR-4: Component Driven Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Frontend UI should be modular, reusable, and easily testable.

## Decision
Develop React UI as small, focused components; use Storybook and CDD practices.

## Consequences
- UI is easy to test and reuse.
- Components can be designed in isolation.
- Simpler to design the API after knowing what a component will need
