# ADR-0: Use Lightweight ADRs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We will use lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important technical decisions in this project. ADRs help us capture the context and reasoning behind our choices, supporting better communication and future maintainability.

- What is an ADR? See [Michael Nygard's original post](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html) and [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/).
- What is a "lightweight" ADR? It is a short, focused record of a decision, often just 1-2 paragraphs.

## Decision
All significant architectural or technical decisions will be recorded as lightweight ADRs in this directory.

## Consequences
- We will have a simple, discoverable history of decisions.
- The process is intentionally low-overhead to encourage adoption.
